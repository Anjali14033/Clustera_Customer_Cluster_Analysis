# CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION PREDICTION

## Project Overview
Clusters is a customer segmentation project utilizing K-Means Clustering to group customers based on their Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. The objective is to discover patterns and similarities in customer behaviour and purchasing habits within an unlabeled dataset. By applying predictive analysis, the project aims to help businesses target their customers more effectively for strategies like Cross-Selling, Upselling, Offers, and Discounts.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES
- Utilize K-Means Clustering to segment customers into distinct groups.
- Uncover categories of customer groups within the dataset.
- Identify patterns and similarities in customer behaviour and purchasing habits.
- Enable targeted marketing strategies based on customer segmentation.
- Enhance business decision-making for Cross-Sell, Upsell, Offers, and Discounts.
